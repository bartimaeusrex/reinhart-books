      That wasn't a <a class="highlighter" href="./20241007">total and unabashed <b>fib</b></a>. I am ashamed of my fibbishness! I <em>have</em> actually tried to do some pixel art and animation. Simple things like rest and walk and run, and of course jump; keeping it all super simple but exploring the inherent complexity within. This right here? This pretty much sums up why I wanted to start this blog: to have some small space on the internet where I could justify and explain these little things I work on sometimes.

      I did a few little guys in this <q>pill</q> style (it occurs to me that maybe I should attempt a crow in this style... a pill crow, get it? eh?). This, according to the file names, is Dill, the cool kid with the backwards cap. Here he is calmly walking, and then he's just had a crazy epiphany about something (maye because he had too many edibles), and so he does a little hop-turn dance thing.

      And that, my friends, is about the extent of my experiments with pixel art & animation. There's a great little mobile app called Pixel Studio where I did most of these. I put it in my GAMES folder because it's so fun to screw around with... when I'm in the mood. For the computer there's Aseprite, which has all the features you could possible want. I think that's where I did the tiles. If you're into this, I can suggest a few YouTube channels to check out of people dedicated to the craft; great teachers but also just so fun to watch these things being created.
