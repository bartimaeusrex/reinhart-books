      In a fit of nostalgia I've been checking some old websites I used to frequent, or post on. One of those was Micropoetry.com. There was another one called Zathom, which had a somewhat competitive aspect to it that was actually kinda fun. Not sure I'll be able to find the things I wrote there, unless I had enough foresight to store them elsewhere first. They may yet turn up. From Micropoetry.com there's only six poems, a couple of which are rehashes from the previous decade, from the previous decade from which these were written. [*knees creaking*] It's easy to forget how ephemeral most websites really are.

      I post these not because I think they're particularly good, but they do represent an interest in the absurd that I still find fascinating. Let's go oldest to most recent (2015, 2017):

      So that's that. It's been pretty much all of a decade since I've really attempted any sort of poetry. Long before then I had a crush on my poetry professor in college so during that semester I produced a handful of poems that were sorta ok to actually maybe kinda good? but also that I'm pleased with for their whimsy and casual creativity. Their somewhat nonsensical imagery and overuse of alliteration. It's one way to deal with a reality that has ventured beyond parody.
